sion# Telecom-Churn-Case-Study

## Objective

This project is the case study on the problem churn in the telecom industry based on the indian and south east asian market, to identify teh churn rate and the cause behind such rate.
Their problem is that, usage-based churn needs to be identified and tackled to avooid high churn in user base of high revenuw customers.
So, a solution is demanded to curb the same.
In this project we have tried to implement a model based on Decision trees to achieve the above goal.

## Details of files given

For this project we have following documents to build and support our case study apart from this read.me file: -
- Telecom_Churn_Case_Study.ipynb : Assignment Python Notebook file.
- PPT Final.pdf : presentation file

## Steps Followed

This project case study is useful for all such platforms which are dealing with lot of applicants on the platform but a much smaller customer conversion rate e.g., let’s say people tend to try a free trial but won’t go for the paid version. It is hard for the companies to find potential customers.
This is how we have approached to the solution:
1.	Reading data dictionary
2.	Loading dataframe
3.	Treating null values with either imputing or dropping them
4.	Filtering the data to keep only high revenue customers in the dataset
5.	Using activity of the first two months, which is the good phase to identify churn.
6.	Tagging churners by assigning a binary variable and removing the churn phase data to prepare the dataset for final model building
7.	Building Decision Tree model
8.	Deploying on test dataframe
9.	Evaluating model
10.	Drawing conclusions from results

This case study is built by a group of three students of a master’s program.
